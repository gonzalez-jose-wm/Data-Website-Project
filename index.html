            <p> Adult overweight And obesity is measured by weight that is higher than what is considered as a "healthy weight" for a certain height. When a individual weighs more than the designated weight it is described as overweight or obese. Body Mass Index known as BMI, is used as a screening tool for overweight or obesity however, it can be used as a screening tool but is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual. </p>

        <div class="contentText">
            <p>In 2007 - 2008 more than one-third of United States adults were obese.
                Obese individuals are at increased risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
                disease, hypertension, and certain cancers, among other conditions.
                Some studies have shown a relationship between obesity prevalence and
                socioeconomic status measured as educational level or income. This
                data brief presents the most recent national data on obesity in United States
                adults and its association with poverty income ratio and education
                level. Results are presented by sex and race and ethnicity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Among men, obesity
                    prevalence is generally similar
                    at all income levels, however,
                    among non-Hispanic black
                    and Mexican-American men
                    those with higher income are
                    more likely to be obese than
                    those with low income. </li>
                <li>Higher income women are
                    less likely to be obese than
                    low income women, but most
                    obese women are not low
                    income.</li>
                <li>There is no significant trend
                    between obesity and education
                    among men. Among women,
                    however, there is a trend, those
                    with college degrees are less
                    likely to be obese compared
                    with less educated women.</li>

        <div class="contentTitle"> <strong> Summary </strong>  </div>
        <br>
        <div class="contentText">
            <p>Among those with less than a high school diploma, the prevalence increased from 22.6% to 32.1%. Similar increases were seen among men with some college or a high school diploma. Among women, the prevalence increased from 15.3% to 23.4% in college graduates and from 31.7% to 42.1% in those with less than a high school diploma. As in men, similar increases were seen among women with a high school diploma and among those with some college. </p>
